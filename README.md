System Health Monitoring Script and Application Health Checker

System Health Monitoring Script - Develop a script that monitors the health of a Linux system. It should check
CPU usage, memory usage, disk space, and running processes. If any of
these metrics exceed predefined thresholds (e.g., CPU usage > 80%), the
script should send an alert to the console or a log file.

The python script is - system_health_monitor.py
To Run the Python Script open command prompt and go to the folder location and type python system_health_monitor.py


Application Health Checker - Please write a script that can check the uptime of an application and
determine if it is functioning correctly or not. The script must accurately
assess the application's status by checking HTTP status codes. It should be
able to detect if the application is 'up', meaning it is functioning correctly, or
'down', indicating that it is unavailable or not responding.

The python script is - check_uptime.py
To Run the Python Script open command prompt and go to the folder location and type python check_uptime.py
